# Home Automation

A JavaScript application simulating house automation: pressing a
button on a control panel would visually turn on a light, change the
temperature or close the curtains.

# Control Panel - Dash Board
The Control Panel dashboard on the top shows the current status of "Curtains", "Lights" & "Room Temparature"

# Access Points (Buttons) 
Added buttons for "Lights", "Curtains". You may toggle the buttons to turn on/off lights & turn on/off curtains. Upon click, the control panel reflects the action/status of the Curtains & Lights

You may also set the thermostat temparature using the Set Thermostatus input field.

# Hosted On Heroku
Please access the JavaScript application @ https://home-automation-app.herokuapp.com/

* *Note:* This application uses https://jsfiddle.net/echo/jsonp/ API from JS Fiddle to echo the user input actions.
